Easy

    Always show time option?  good for pm vits

    Default to has values with category for dates beyond recent
        need ui to settle back or maybe use main menu?

    Maybe opening sort with has values at top?
        might be an issue because things jump around?
        but haven't used it that way lately
        maybe keep sorted as long as all have values are in top 10?

Med
	* item search
	        not being able to find items is ridiculous
	        near matching


Low Priority

Easy
    update all items to private

    Edit description should show full context:
        date, name, value?


Med
    *   change drops to exp

	*    Highlight a group in history
	        like all the ratings fields.
	        For looking through history for good days

	        maybe this goes with the filter idea -- might be simpler
	        instead of single highlight, highlight several?
    *   rename category

    *    Right swipe to change day would be nice
    *    show only has value in section for old dates

    Note: Some input files use or override a deprecated API.
    Note: Recompile with -Xlint:deprecation for details.

    Holo theme:
        <style name="MyTheme" parent="android:Theme.Holo">
        need to change title: android.util.AndroidRuntimeException: You cannot combine custom titles with other title features

	*    Category cutoff time. Warn for changes before hour or highlight color like history or both
	        strong case: entering sleep time for current instead of previous day
	        in that case before cutoff previous day would be current so don't warn
	        although I don't think there's a warning for previous day

    *    Weekly auto backup to last backup spot. naming, sharing?



Hard

	*    Support unit history and changing units

	filter
	    option: Include next and previous days
	    Highlight good result days and include only
            Filter. Pick fields gt 5...

        work GT 7 and what? but Or's ... -- *** save search.
	    maybe just filter?
	    might not be so bad with iterating over cursor and doing it on Java side?

    Sibling Categories?
        Need to share items between categories or have items in 2 categories
            main case: AM and Post Lunch

        this is a bit of work... but duplicating items is painful too...
        also, sometimes night vits become am vits -- what about that?
        Options
            from/to
            
        if no categoryId in value -- just show it everywhere if it has a value

        Mid day and am share items

        Does this make more sense than - Multiple categories for item?

    	need directionality and has values or all?
    	    cases:
    	    1. show items to set in multiple categories
    	    2. show item values because they're relevant in other sections


	Need to history include some items in previous day
	    needs full use case?
	    Wake up Notes should be visible when browsing previous day?
    	    Add a small notation to show it's the next day.
    	        Maybe an icon that supports a toast explanation

        In category and all item history

        Maybe also previous categories same day
            sleep trouble relates to am & noon vits

    Category always show option
        Will always be included in other categories. 
        Or maybe <category> is sibling to am.pm vits


Out of Scope?
*    Per week goals with auto monitoring like twice for exercise



****************************************************************************************************
	*    Title history and headline sections with old titles in detail history and apply to group history

	*    Need to hide things and show before making new?
	*    Allow deletes. Keep a log of deletes and backups. Don't allow delete when something isn't backed up?
	*    Allow hiding so an item doesn't close the list but can be seen in the right category with show all and also the hidden category
